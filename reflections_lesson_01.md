`Q:` How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?
`A:` viewing a diff between two versions of a file helps find bugs 
allowing you to visually inspect what has changed, between the files. I was able to easily spot the error that was introduced in the new file and also identify the exact location of the error, which made it easy to fix.

`Q:` How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?
`A:` having easy access to the entire history of a file can make you a more efficient programmer in the long term by giving you the ability to track a file's evolution. This could be one way in which you discover whether your code has become better or worse.

`Q:` What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?
`A:` Manual commits allow the user to save state at times that are best for the user. that is, after completing a particular fix or adding  a piece of new functionality.

`Q:` Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
`A:` Git is a true version control system, as such Git is designed to track changes in individual files and/or across multiples files to provide the user with the most useful infromation regarding the fles being tracked.
Systems like Google Docs, are not true version controls application, that is they provide just basic tracking functionality, usually only for individual files at any particular time.


`Q:` How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
`A:` The git log & git diff provide information reflecting who made a change, when changes were made & what was changed. If the user provided a useful message then the command also provide an indication of the nature of the change.

`Q:` How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?
`A:` When using version control, a coder can be more confident in making changes due to the fact that any change that might introduce an error or unintended side effect can easily be found and remedied

`Q:` Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
