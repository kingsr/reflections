## Reflections - Lesson 2
`Q:` What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
`A:` git init, used to initialize or create an empty repository, performs the steps to setup the new repository and places a folder named .git in the folder where the command was executed.

`Q:` How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
`A:` The staging area holds files that are ready to be committed.  If there are multiple files they will all be committed under a single commit id. Files still in the working directory will remain uncommitted until they have been placed into the staging area.
